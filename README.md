# Simple search application implementation of John Romani

## API
I choose to implement with [Tomtom's POI online search](https://developer.tomtom.com/online-search/online-search-documentation-search/points-interest-search).

## Comments and solutions to unclear instructions
* In UI there seemed to be a delete step, but not accordning to the UX. I followed the UI.
* Graphics for delete button was missing under /assets. I improvised a similar one to the one in reference screen.png
* No specific design for Desktop and Tablets was given, improvised responsive solution.
* Didn't find SVG-logo found in /assets stable enough in all browsers. Converted in to PNG
